"""Deliverable filenames must be reserved atomically, and re-reserved on repair.

Downloads are attributed by filename alone, so a name may belong to only one
call that can still receive files. Two paths broke that guarantee:

Preparation checked the names, then spent time copying and hashing inputs, then
published. Two preparations overlapping in that window both saw the names free.

Repair reopens a finished exchange. Finished exchanges have already released
their names, so another call may have taken them in the meantime; repair
transitioned the old one back to ACTIVE without looking.
