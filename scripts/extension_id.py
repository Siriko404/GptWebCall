"""Work out the Chrome extension ID for this checkout's `extension\\` directory.

The host manifest must pin one exact `chrome-extension://<id>/` origin, and that
id used to be copied by hand off `chrome://extensions`. Thirty-two characters
transcribed by a person is the step an install fails on, and it forced an order
on the install too: the extension had to be loaded before the host could be
registered, because there was no id until then.

Neither is necessary. Chrome derives an unpacked extension's id from where it
sits on disk, so the id exists before Chrome has ever seen the directory, and
once Chrome has seen it the id is recorded in that profile's own preferences.

Three sources, most authoritative first:

1. An id the caller supplies. Nothing overrides an explicit instruction.
2. Chrome's own state: the profile that has this exact directory loaded knows
   its id as a fact rather than a derivation.
3. The derivation: SHA-256 of the absolute path encoded UTF-16LE, first sixteen
   bytes, each hex digit mapped onto a..p. Verified against a real installed
   extension, and it is what lets the host be registered first.

Windows and Linux, like the rest of the installer. UTF-16LE is how Chrome
encodes a path on both platforms.

On Linux the derivation is unchanged — UTF-16LE is how Chrome encodes a path
there too — and the profile data lives under ~/.config/<browser>/ instead of
%LOCALAPPDATA%\\Google\\Chrome\\User Data. The first browser directory that
exists wins, overridable with GPTWEBCALL_BROWSER_DATA.
