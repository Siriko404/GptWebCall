.SYNOPSIS
Register the GPT Web Call native-messaging host for one already-loaded extension.

.DESCRIPTION
The host manifest must name one exact extension ID in allowed_origins, with no
wildcard. That ID used to be typed in by hand off chrome://extensions, which
forced the extension to be loaded first and made a thirty-two character
transcription part of the install.

Neither is needed. Chrome derives an unpacked extension's ID from where it sits
on disk, so scripts\extension_id.py works it out: from Chrome's own profile data
when the extension is already loaded, and from the path itself when it is not.
Pass -ExtensionId to override both.

Everything is checked before anything is written. A missing prerequisite fails
here, with the reason, rather than surfacing later as a side panel that says the
companion is unavailable.

.PARAMETER ExtensionId
Optional. Overrides the resolved ID; use it only when chrome://extensions
disagrees with what this script reports.

.PARAMETER WhatIf
Report what would be done and change nothing.
