"""Move this checkout to the latest published version.

Only the git half lives here. Re-registering afterwards is `setup.py`, which is
idempotent and already knows how; running it is a visible step the operator
sees, because `install_skill.py` writes into `~/.claude` and that is outside
this project.

The skills themselves need no reinstalling: `install_skill.py` registers this
checkout as a plugin source in place rather than copying it, so a fast-forward
updates the installed skills the moment it lands. What it does not do is make
Claude Code notice - plugins register at startup - which is why a restart is
reported as a step rather than assumed.

The refusals are the reason this is a script rather than a paragraph in a skill.
A session can skip an instruction; it cannot skip a non-zero exit.

Updating while a call is running is the one that would actually cost something.
The extension's download monitor lives in the code being replaced, so an update
mid-flight loses the files a call is waiting for — and the operator would be
looking at a panel that says everything is fine.

A script replacing itself mid-run is fine here, and was measured rather than
assumed: on Windows, `git merge --ff-only` over a running Python script returns
0, the new bytes land, and the already-compiled process runs to completion.
