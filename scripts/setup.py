"""Install GPT Web Call end to end. One command, run once, from the checkout.

    python scripts/setup.py
    python scripts/setup.py --dry-run     # report the plan, change nothing
    python scripts/setup.py --no-browser  # do not open Chrome or wait for it

There are two halves and they used to be separate errands: the native-messaging
host that lets Chrome talk to the companion, and the `webcall` skills that give
an agent session a way to drive it. Neither is useful without the other, and
doing one and forgetting the other produces a system that looks installed and
does nothing.

Everything a machine can do is done here, including the parts around the one
step it cannot. Loading an unpacked extension is that step: Chrome removed
`--load-extension` from stable, and a profile's preferences are HMAC-protected
against being written by hand. Verified against Chrome 151 — launching with
`--load-extension` on a fresh profile leaves the extension absent.

So the click stays with a person, and everything else does not. This opens
chrome://extensions, puts the folder path on the clipboard so it can be pasted
into the picker rather than navigated to, waits for Chrome to record the
extension, and then checks that what Chrome loaded is what the host was pinned
to — repinning by itself if they disagree. The only other human step is
restarting Claude Code, because slash commands register at startup.
