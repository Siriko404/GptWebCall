"""Register the GPT Web Call native-messaging host on Linux.

The counterpart of install.ps1, which does the same job through the registry.
On Linux there is no registry indirection: Chrome reads the host manifest
directly out of a per-browser `NativeMessagingHosts/` directory, so rendering
`native-host/com.sina.gptwebcall.template.json` and putting it there *is* the
registration.

The manifest must name one exact extension ID in allowed_origins, with no
wildcard. Chrome derives an unpacked extension's ID from where it sits on
disk, so scripts/extension_id.py works it out — from the browser's own profile
data when the extension is already loaded, and from the path itself when it is
not. Pass --extension-id to override both.

Everything is checked before anything is written. A missing prerequisite fails
here, with the reason, rather than surfacing later as a side panel that says
the companion is unavailable.
